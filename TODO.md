## User class

Represents a User and its data:

- Name
- Age

Needs the ability to store some data, retrieve it, and change it

Needs to have the ability to notify the rest of the app when some data is changed

Needs to be able to persist data to an outside server, and then retrieve it at some future point

## Extract User class

Further down the line we want to extract the 'mega' class of user into multiple components, using composistion.

Then do a second refactor to generalise the class to something reusable AKA not a user anymore
